Hi! My name is Ryan but my internet pseudonym is Stillie. I am a mobile developer by profession who's main focus is [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/){:target="_blank"} development.

I used to do Android Native development in Java/Kotlin but currently I am enjoying Flutter due to the wide range or ecosystems I can develop for without too much hassle.

You can find me on the following platforms:
