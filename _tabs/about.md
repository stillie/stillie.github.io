Hi! My name is Ryan but my internet pseudonym is Stillie. I am an Engineering lead for Mobile who's main focus is [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/){:target="_blank"} development. I have been in the mobile development space for 8 years but I was in tech support before that for about 11 years

Before I was a Flutter developer I was an Android Native developer but currently I am enjoying Flutter due to the wide range or ecosystems I can develop for without too much hassle.

In my personal time I spend it dabbling with my Home Lab, private projects in the mobile space as well Linux administration. Anything and everything in the tech space interests me.

On this website you will find everything I want to document that I think other people may find interesting.
